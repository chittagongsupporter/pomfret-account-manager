# Stakeholders Analysis

## 1. Introduction
- **Project Name:** Pomfret Account Manager  
- **Document Purpose:** Identification & analysis of key stakeholders, and their concerns/priorities.
  This will ensure that the design of the system & its requirements is a reflection of real needs of those impacted.
- **Version & Date:** v0.1 — [2025-09-19]

## 2. Stakeholder Identification
- **Primary Stakeholders:**  
  - End users who need to add, remove, or edit accounts.  
  - Product owner (myself), responsible for defining scope and ensuring delivery.  

- **Secondary Stakeholders:**  
  - Developers and testers (myself in multiple roles).  
  - Future support staff or maintainers (if project expands).  

- **Key Beneficiaries:**  
  - End users — who save time and reduce frustration.  
  - Myself — who benefits from project ownership, learning, and efficiency gains.

|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| End Users        | Intuitive interface, fast task completion, security       |
| Product Owner    | Feasibility, timely delivery, clear scope                 |
| Developers/Testers | Maintainability, code simplicity, minimized bugs        |
| Support Staff    | Low support overhead, clear error handling                |

- **Medium Priority:** Developers/Testers  
- **Low Priority:** Support Staff (until scaling is required)

## 5. Next Steps
This stakeholder analysis establishes the basis for:  
1. **Requirements Specification (`requirements.md`)** — translating concerns into functional and non-functional requirements.  
2. **Architecture & Design (`architecture.md`)** — ensuring the structure addresses high-priority stakeholder needs.
