# Stakeholders Analysis

## 1. Introduction
- **Project Name:** Pomfret Account Manager  
- **Document Purpose:** Identify and analyze the key stakeholders, their concerns, and priorities.  
  Ensures that the lightweight Python implementation addresses real user needs.  
- **Version & Date:** v0.2 — [2025-09-19]

## 2. Stakeholder Identification
- **Primary Stakeholders:**  
  - End users who want a simple way to add, remove, or edit accounts locally.  
  - Product owner (myself), responsible for scope and delivery.  

- **Secondary Stakeholders:**  
  - Developers and testers (myself in multiple roles).  
  - Future maintainers who may adapt the codebase.  

- **Key Beneficiaries:**  
  - End users — reduced friction in managing accounts without complexity.  
  - Myself — gaining practical efficiency and ownership of a lightweight solution.

## 3. Stakeholder Concerns
| Stakeholder Role | Concerns / Interests                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| End Users        | Simple interface, fast setup, data stays local & private   |
| Product Owner    | Feasibility, low maintenance, secure local storage         |
| Developers/Testers | Code readability, minimal dependencies, easy debugging   |
| Future Maintainers | Clear documentation, modular structure                   |

## 4. Prioritization of Stakeholders
- **High Priority:** End Users, Product Owner  
- **Medium Priority:** Developers/Testers  
- **Low Priority:** Future Maintainers (until scaling is needed)

## 5. Next Steps
This analysis informs:  
1. **Requirements Specification (`requirements.md`)** — aligning requirements with local, file-based storage and CLI interaction.  
2. **Architecture Overview (`architecture.md`)** — ensuring simplicity and modularity reflect stakeholder needs.
