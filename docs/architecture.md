# Architecture Overview

## 1. Introduction
- **Project Name:** Pomfret Account Manager  
- **Document Purpose:** Describe the high-level architecture and rationale of the system.  
  Provides a structural blueprint for implementation based on the requirements.  
- **Version & Date:** v0.1 — [2025-09-19]  

---

## 2. Architectural Goals & Constraints
- **Goals:** Simplicity, usability, security, and maintainability.  
- **Constraints:**  
  - Plain Python implementation (no external databases or APIs).  
  - Local-only execution environment.  
  - Solo development and limited scope for first release.  

---

## 3. System Context
The Pomfret Account Manager will run locally as a standalone Python application. Users will interact through a simple command-line interface (CLI) or minimal text-based UI. Account data will be stored securely in local files, with encryption to protect sensitive information.  

*(Optional: insert a simple context diagram showing user → CLI → local storage.)*

## 4. High-Level Design
- **User Interface (CLI):**  
  - Menu-driven interface in the terminal.  
  - Options to add, remove, edit, and list accounts.  

- **Application Logic:**  
  - Implemented in plain Python modules.  
  - Provides core operations (create, read, update, delete).  

- **Data Storage:**  
  - Accounts stored in local JSON or CSV files.  
  - Files encrypted to ensure confidentiality.  

- **Security:**  
  - Basic password-based authentication.  
  - Local encryption/decryption of data files.

## 5. Rationale & Alternatives
- **Chosen Approach:**  
  - File-based storage keeps the system lightweight and easy to run.  
  - Plain Python ensures accessibility and simplicity without setup overhead.  

- **Alternatives Considered:**  
  - Database storage (excluded to reduce complexity).  
  - Web or API-based system (deferred until later versions).

## 6. Next Steps
This architecture provides the blueprint for:  
1. **Detailed Design** — specifying module structure and file formats.  
2. **Implementation & Testing** — building the Python modules and verifying functionality.
