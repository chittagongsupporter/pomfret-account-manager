# Project Specifications

## 1. Introduction
- **Project Name:** Pomfret Account Manager  
- **Document Purpose:** Define the minimal requirements and structure of a simple account manager.  
- **Scope:** Python program that manages accounts (email + password) in memory.  
- **Version & Date:** v0.1 â€” [2025-09-19]  

---

## 2. Vision
Provide a lightweight Python tool that allows basic management of accounts during runtime.  
The program is not persistent (data disappears after exit), but establishes a foundation for future extensions like file storage or encryption.  

---

## 3. Goals
- Add, edit, and remove accounts easily.  
- Keep design and implementation minimal.  
- Lay groundwork for persistence and security later.  

---

## 4. Stakeholders
- **Primary:** End users who want a simple local account manager.  
- **Secondary:** Developer (myself), maintaining and extending the code.

## 5. Functional Requirements
| ID   | Requirement Description                          | Priority |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| FR-1 | User can add accounts (email + password).        | High     |
| FR-2 | User can edit existing account details.          | High     |
| FR-3 | User can remove accounts.                        | High     |
| FR-4 | User can list all accounts currently in memory.  | Medium   |

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Usability:** Commands or functions should be simple and clear.  
- **Maintainability:** Code should be modular (functions/classes).  
- **Performance:** Handle at least ~100 accounts instantly in memory.  

---

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions
- Data is stored **in memory only** (not persistent).  
- No encryption or authentication in this version.  
- Python standard library only.  

---

## 8. Architecture Overview
- **Data Model:**  
  - Each account stored as a dictionary or object with fields: `email`, `password`.  
  - All accounts stored in a list or dictionary in memory.  

- **Operations:**  
  - Functions for add, edit, remove, and list accounts.  
  - Simple CLI interaction or direct function calls.  

---

## 9. Next Steps
1. Implement account management functions in Python.  
2. Add a simple CLI to call these functions.  
3. Consider persistence (file storage) in future versions.  

---

## 10. References
- Python Standard Library (for CLI interaction: `argparse` or `input()`).
