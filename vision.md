# Project Vision

## 1. Introduction
- **Project Name:** Pomfret Account Manager 
- **Document Purpose:** Defines the high-level vision and goals of the project.  
  Serves as the foundation for stakeholder analysis and detailed requirements.  
- **Version & Date:** v0.1 — [2025-09-19]  

---

## 2. Vision Statement
We envision an easy-to-use interface for the user to manage all of their accounts in 1 unified application.
This simplifies account management for the user, and as a result, this solution empowers users with a foundation to confidently grow
their account portfolio.

---

## 3. Problem Context
- **The Need:** In the present day, with the growing number of accounts a user creates, there is a stronger necessity for users to be able to manage multiple accounts in one central application.
- **Why It Matters:** For customers, a lack of central organization frustrates them, and for organizations, it would cost money and time
to inefficiently manage accounts. 
- **Why Now:** The more time it takes for a solution to be envisioned and manifested into reality. The more customers will be frustrated and organizations will lose on time and money.

## 4. Goals and Desired Outcomes
- **High-Level Goals:**  
  - Provide users with a unified and intuitive interface for account management.
  - Minimize complexity with account creation, removal, & modification.
- **Desired Outcomes:**  
  - Increase user satisfcation by 50% within 3 months of release.   
  - Users can complete account management tasks (add, remove, edit) in under 1 minute.

## 5. High-Level Scope
- **In Scope:** We are aiming to create a central interface including add, remove, and edit operations.  
- **Out of Scope:** Features not related directly to account management such as payments & messaging. No mobile-native support.

---

## 6. Anticipated Stakeholders
*(To be detailed in stakeholders-analysis.md)*  
- **Primary Stakeholders (expected):** 
    - End user who need to add, remove, or edit their accounts.
    - Product owner.
- **Secondary Stakeholders (expected):**
    - Developers and testers (myself in multiple roles).
- **Key Beneficiaries:**
    - End users.
    - Myself as the project owner.

---

## 7. Success Criteria
- At least 90% of users can use all 3 account management operations without external help.
- At least 80% of users can perform account management tasks in less than 30 seconds.

---

## 8. Risks and Challenges (Early View)
- **Technical Risk:** Maintaining secure handling of user account data may require additional expertise.
- **Usability Challenge:** The interface may be obfuscated and must be designed carefully.
- **Adoption Risk:** If the solution is difficult to use and/or integrate, users may fail to see value in adopting it.
- **Time/Resource Constraint:** As a solo developer, progress may be slower and dependent on available time and knowledge

## 9. Next Steps
This vision establishes the foundation for:  
1. **Stakeholders Analysis (`stakeholders-analysis.md`)**  Identify the key stakeholders and their concerns and priorities to
ensure this project addresses them.
2. **Requirements Specification (`requirements.md`)**  Translate stakeholders' needs into functional and non-functional requirements,
to guide design, implementation, &  testing.
3. **Architecture & Design (`architecture.md`)** Define the system's structure and rationale in order to ensure scalability, security &
usability.
