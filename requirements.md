# Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction
- **Project Name:** Pomfret Account Manager  
- **Document Purpose:** Define the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.  
  Requirements are based on the lightweight Python architecture with CLI and local file storage.  
- **Version & Date:** v0.2 — [2025-09-19]  

---

## 2. System Overview
Pomfret Account Manager will be a standalone Python application that runs locally.  
It will provide a command-line interface (CLI) where users can add, edit, remove, and list accounts.  
All account data will be stored securely in local files with basic encryption.

## 3. Functional Requirements
| ID   | Requirement Description                                | Priority |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| FR-1 | User can add new accounts via CLI.                     | High     |
| FR-2 | User can edit details of existing accounts.             | High     |
| FR-3 | User can remove accounts.                               | High     |
| FR-4 | User can view a list of all accounts.                   | Medium   |
| FR-5 | Data is saved automatically to a local file.            | High     |
| FR-6 | System authenticates user before granting access.       | Medium   |

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
| Category       | Requirement Example                                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Usability      | CLI commands are intuitive and documented in `--help`. |
| Security       | Accounts file is encrypted locally.                    |
| Reliability    | No data loss after unexpected shutdowns.               |
| Performance    | Handle up to 500 accounts with instant response times. |
| Maintainability | Clear, modular Python code with docstrings.           |

---

## 5. Constraints & Assumptions
- No external database or API usage — local storage only.  
- Runs with plain Python (minimal dependencies).  
- Encryption depends on Python standard library or one lightweight package.  
- Single-user system (no multi-user support).

## 6. Next Steps
This specification provides the foundation for:  
1. **Architecture & Design (`architecture.md`)** — ensuring the CLI and file-based modules are well-structured.  
2. **Implementation & Testing** — building and validating the Python modules.
