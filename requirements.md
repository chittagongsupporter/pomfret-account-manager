# Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction
- **Project Name:** Pomfret Account Manager  
- **Document Purpose:** Define the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.  
  These requirements are derived from the vision and stakeholder concerns.  
- **Version & Date:** v0.1 — [2025-09-19]

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
| Category       | Requirement Example                                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Usability      | 90% of users can complete add/remove/edit in <30 seconds.    |
| Security       | All account data encrypted in transit and at rest.           |
| Reliability    | 99% uptime target.                                           |

## 6. Next Steps
This specification will guide:  
1. **Architecture & Design (`architecture.md`)** — defining how requirements map to system structure.  
2. **Implementation & Testing** — building features to meet these requirements.
